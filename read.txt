A girlfriend gave a challenge to her boyfriend to live a day without her. No communication at all and said if he passed it, she'll love him forever. The boyfriend agreed. He never texted nor called his girlfriend for a whole day without knowing, his girlfriend has only 24 hours left because she was dying because of cancer. After a day, he excitedly went to his girlfriend "I did it baby" but tear fell as he saw his girlfriend lying in a coffin with a note "You did it baby.. Now please do it everyday 
I love you".
